    <h1>The Olympic Games</h1>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Olympia, the center of Greek civilization, was a sacred place for religious ceremonies 
        as well as the host to the Ancient Games. The Ancient Olympic Games started as a religious 
        festival held in a Zeus's sanctuary. Zeus, King of Greek Gods was speculated to have 
        made his home in Olympia around 1200BC and marked his territory by striking a thunderbolt 
        into the ground atop Mount Olympus. </p>
     <p> Every 4th year between 776 B.C.E and 395 C.E. the Games were held to honor Zeus in the sanctuary 
        itself. Sacrifices and gifts were offered and athletes took oaths to obey rules before a 
        statue of Zeus. The sacred olive tree of Zeus marked the finishing line for all races. There 
        were over 70 different altars as the Greeks were polytheistic, so individuals had the ability 
        to sacrifice to anyone they desired. Despite the multiple renovations of the stadium to hold 
        more people, the length of the track remained constant with a length of 600 feet to represent 
        the distance Hercules could run on a single breath. In order to commemorate champions, 
        winners were allowed to put up statues of themselves inside the sanctuary of Zeus. </p>
    <p> The Games created a week of madness with individuals from all over Greece showing up 
        to gain status. It was a time of chaos, excitement and anyone who wanted to be someone 
        showed up. Until early Christian times the games at Olympia were constant until eventually
        transforming into the modern Olympic Games, first staged in Athens in 1896.</p>
